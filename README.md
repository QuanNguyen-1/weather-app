# weather-app
This is a simple weather app made with the use of OpenWeatherMap API, React, Javascript, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap. Entering a city into the search bar will return the weather information about that specific city. This information includes the temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind. There is also an additional component that will display an icon based on the weather condition.
